# Contributing

üòç Thank you for contributing to **`MicroAI: Personal Assistant`**! üòç

## Philosophy

I aim to make MicroAI as fast, robust, secure and reliable as possible, while also allowing for extensive customization.

If you spot anywhere that I could trim some expense and improve performance, or add new functionality, I will gladly accept new issues or PRs! üòÑ

## Formatting

You may use Python's default formatting tool for your files, or anyother tool that you see fit

## Git/GitHub workflow

This is my preferred process for opening a PR on GitHub:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a branch off of `master` for your work: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`
3. Make some changes, committing them along the way
4. When your changes are ready for review, push your branch: `git push origin my-feature-branch`
5. Create a pull request from your branch to `Personal-Assistant/master`
6. No need to assign the pull request to me, I'll review it when I can
7. When the changes have been reviewed and approved, I will squash and merge for you
