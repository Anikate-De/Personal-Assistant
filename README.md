## üìñLessons Learned

**`MicroAI`** was a really important project for me. I presented this project as a part of my high-school graduation skill. Although the event asked for something way less intuitive than something like this, I put in a lot of effort to make this the best one ever made in my school.

I learnt many things along the way, the most notable ones are mentioned below -

- Tkinter
- Python-MySQL interfacing
- WolframAlpha Client
- TTS
- Many other python libraries
- **and so much more...**
